    <h3> What is Fire Safety? </h3>
    <p> 
        Fire safety is the set of practices implemented to reduce the damage caused by fire. Fire safety measures include those that are intended to prevent ignition of an uncontrolled fire, and those that are used to limit the development and effects of a fire after it starts.
